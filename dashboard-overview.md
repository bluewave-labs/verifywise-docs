# üíª Dashboard overview

The dashboard is the first thing users see after signing in. It gives a quick health check for every compliance project, highlights recent activity, and offers one-click access to deeper views. Think of it as the command center that answers two big questions: ‚ÄúHow close are we to full compliance?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhere should I focus right now?‚Äù



On the Dashboard, you can see an overview of your projects, the compliance status of your projects, and the risk status of all of your projects.

Dashboard components are as follows:

1. **Projects overview:** Here, you can see the general status of individual projects. For each project, several statistics are listed. Click `View project` to open a specific project overview, or click `New project`to add a new project to your VerifyWise instance.
2. **Navigation menu**, which will be explained below.

### Navigation menu

A narrow sidebar on the left keeps the main sections one click away.

* **Dashboard**: Your current view, shows project progress at a glance.
* **Vendors:** Manage third parties and their risk scores.
* **Evidences:** Upload and tag proofs that back up each control.
* **Reporting:** Generate exportable summaries for auditors or execs.
* **Settings:** Adjust organization preferences, users, and security.

### Creating a new project

Click the green **New project** button in the top right corner. A three-step wizard appears:

1. Enter a project name.
2. Pick a framework template if you want pre-loaded controls.
3. Assign an owner.

Hit **Create** and the project pops into the grid with progress bars at zero. You can start adding subcontrols and assessments right away.
