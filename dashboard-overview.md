# üíª Dashboard overview

The dashboard is the first thing users see after signing in. It gives a quick health check for every compliance project, highlights recent activity, and offers one-click access to deeper views. Think of it as the command center that answers two big questions: ‚ÄúHow close are we to full compliance?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhere should I focus right now?‚Äù



On the Dashboard, you can see an overview of your projects, the compliance status of your projects, and the risk status of all of your projects.

Dashboard components are as follows:

1. **Projects overview:** Here, you can see the general status of individual projects. For each project, several statistics are listed. Click `View project` to open a specific project overview, or click `New project`to add a new project to your VerifyWise instance.
2. **Navigation menu**, which will be explained below.

### Navigation menu

A narrow sidebar on the left keeps the main sections one click away. The navigation is organized into core features and additional tools:

**Core Features:**
* **Dashboard**: Your current view, shows project progress and compliance status at a glance
* **Vendors**: Manage third-party vendors, assess their risk scores, and track vendor relationships
* **Evidences**: Upload, organize, and tag documentary proofs that back up each compliance control
* **Reporting**: Generate exportable compliance summaries and reports for auditors or executives
* **Bias & Fairness**: Analyze AI models for bias detection and fairness evaluation
* **Training Registry**: Manage AI governance training programs and track completion status
* **Policy Manager**: Create, maintain, and enforce AI governance policies across your organization
* **AI Trust Center**: Build and manage public-facing transparency hubs for stakeholder trust
* **Model Inventory**: Comprehensive tracking and management of all AI/ML models and their lifecycle

**Additional Tools:**
* **Event Tracker**: Monitor system activities, user actions, and compliance events with detailed audit trails
* **Settings**: Configure user profiles, team management, organization details, and system preferences
* **Feedback**: Provide feedback and suggestions through GitHub discussions
* **Ask on Discord**: Connect with the VerifyWise community for support and collaboration

### Creating a new project

Click the green **New project** button in the top right corner. A three-step wizard appears:

1. Enter a project name.
2. Pick a framework template if you want pre-loaded controls.
3. Assign an owner.

Hit **Create** and the project pops into the grid with progress bars at zero. You can start adding subcontrols and assessments right away.
