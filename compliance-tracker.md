## 📊 Understanding Compliance Management

### Why Compliance Tracking Matters
**Regulatory Adherence**:
- EU AI Act compliance verification and documentation
- Systematic tracking of regulatory requirement implementation
- Evidence collection for audit and inspection readiness
- Structured approach to compliance gap identification

**Risk Mitigation**:

### Compliance Framework Structure
**Hierarchical Organization**:
```
Section X: Major Compliance Area
├── Control X.Y: Specific Requirement
    ├── Subcontrol X.Y.Z: Actionable Measure
    │   ├── Evidence: Supporting Documentation
    │   ├── Status: Implementation Progress
    │   └── Reviews: Approval Workflow
```

**Numbering System**:
- **Section**: Major compliance areas (1, 2, 3...)
- **Control**: Specific requirements (X.1, X.2, X.3...)
- **Subcontrol**: Granular measures (X.Y.1, X.Y.2, X.Y.3...)

**Example Structure**:
```
Section 3: Human Oversight
Control 3.2: Oversight Documentation
Subcontrol 3.2.1: We document system limitations and human oversight options
```
