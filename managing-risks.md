## 🔧 Risk Registration and Management

### Creating New Risks

#### Risk Identification Tab
**Required Information**:
```
Risk Details:
- Risk Name: Clear, descriptive identifier
- Action Owner: Responsible team member
- AI Lifecycle Phase: Development stage when risk applies
- Risk Description: Detailed explanation of the risk
- Potential Impact: Consequences if risk materializes
- Risk Category: Classification (Technical, Operational, Compliance, etc.)
```

**Optional Information**:
- **Review Notes**: Additional context or observations
- **Related Controls**: Links to compliance controls or requirements
- **Dependencies**: Other risks or projects that may be affected
- **Historical Context**: Previous occurrences or lessons learned

#### Risk Assessment
**Likelihood Assessment**:
- **Very Likely** (>75% probability): Expected to occur
- **Likely** (50-75% probability): Probable occurrence
- **Possible** (25-50% probability): May occur under certain conditions
- **Unlikely** (<25% probability): Low probability of occurrence

**Severity Assessment**:
- **Critical**: Project failure, significant regulatory violations, major business impact
- **High**: Substantial delays, moderate compliance issues, notable business consequences
- **Medium**: Minor delays, limited compliance concerns, manageable business impact
- **Low**: Negligible impact on project, compliance, or business objectives

**Automated Risk Level Calculation**:
The system automatically calculates overall risk level by combining likelihood and severity ratings using a standardized risk matrix.

### Mitigation Planning

#### Mitigation Strategy Development
**Mitigation Tab Components**:
- **Mitigation Status**: Current stage of risk response
- **Current Risk Level**: Initial risk assessment before mitigation
- **Start Date**: When mitigation activities begin
- **Mitigation Plan**: Detailed response strategy and actions
- **Implementation Strategy**: Specific steps and resource requirements

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk by changing approach or scope
- **Mitigate**: Reduce likelihood or impact through controls
- **Transfer**: Share or shift risk to third parties
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor risk without active mitigation

#### Implementation Planning
**Resource Requirements**:
- Personnel assignments and responsibilities
- Budget allocation for mitigation activities
- Technology or tool requirements
- Timeline and milestone definition

**Success Criteria**:
- Measurable objectives for mitigation effectiveness
- Key performance indicators and metrics
- Acceptance criteria for risk closure
- Monitoring and review requirements

### Approval Workflow

#### Approval Process
**Approval Components**:
- **Approver**: Designated person responsible for risk approval
- **Approval Status**: Current state (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
- **Start Date**: When approved mitigation begins
- **Recommendation Notes**: Approver feedback and guidance

**Workflow Stages**:
1. **Submission**: Risk owner submits complete risk assessment and mitigation plan
2. **Review**: Designated approver evaluates risk details and mitigation strategy
3. **Feedback**: Approver provides comments, questions, or recommendations
4. **Revision**: Risk owner addresses feedback and resubmits if needed
5. **Approval**: Final approval and authorization for mitigation implementation
6. **Implementation**: Execute approved mitigation plan with monitoring
