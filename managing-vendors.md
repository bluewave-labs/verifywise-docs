# üë®‚Äçüíª Managing vendors

The Vendor Management module in VerifyWise allows organizations to track, assess, and manage AI providers that they use in their projects. This system helps maintain a centralized record of all external vendors that provide AI-related products, services, or components, along with their review status, risk levels, and associated documentation.

Each listed vendor has a name, an assignee to that vendor, a vendor status indicator, the risk status of the vendor, and a review date.

By clicking the gear icon in the rightmost column, a given vendor can be edited or removed from the project.

### Add or edit a vendor

You can change a vendor's settings by clicking the corresponding gear icon and then 'Edit'. Alternatively, click `Add new vendor` on the top right corner of the screen to create a new vendor.
