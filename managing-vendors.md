### Vendors screen

Each listed vendor has a name, an assignee to that vendor, a vendor status indicator, the risk status of the vendor, and a review date.

By clicking the gear icon in the rightmost column, a given vendor can be edited or removed from the project.

### Add or edit a vendor

You can change a vendor's settings by clicking the corresponding gear icon and then 'Edit'. Alternatively, click `Add new vendor` on the top right corner of the screen to create a new vendor.

### Vendor details

To add a new vendor to a project, you need to first provide details on the vendor.

To add a new vendor, add the following to the "Vendor details" tab. Just a note that when a vendor is added, it is available for all projects.

1. **Vendor name**
2. **Website:** Provide a URL to the vendor's website.
3. **Project name:** Select the project that the vendor is assigned to.
4. **"What does the vendor provide?":** Explain how the vendor is integrated with your AI application.
5. **Vendor contact person:** Provide the full name of a contact from the vendor.
6. **Review status (Active/ Under review/ Not active):** Select the appropriate review status.
7. **Reviewer:** Designate the organization member responsible for the review.
8. **Review result:** If a review has been conducted, report the result of the review.
9. **Risk status (Very low/ Low/ Medium/ High/ Very High):** Note the risk status of the new vendor.
10. **Assignee:** Assign someone to the vendor.
11. **Review date:** Note down the date of vendor review, if one was conducted.
12. If done, click `Save`.

### **Risks**

If the vendor poses any risks, this needs to be monitored. The "Risks" tab allows users to provide details on risks posed by the new vendor, if any.

* **Risk description:** The risk that may be posed by the new vendor.
* **Impact description:** The (hypothetical) impact of the risk.

* **Probability:** Possibility of the risk causing disruption
* **Risk severity (Critical/ Major/ Minor):** The acuteness of danger (e.g. to data privacy or human safety) posed by the risk
* **Action plan:** An action plan to mitigate and/or avert the risk
* **Action owner:** The person responsible for mitigating this risk and implementing the action plan
