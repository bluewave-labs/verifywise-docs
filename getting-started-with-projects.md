### Planning Your Project Structure

Before creating your project, consider these strategic questions:

**AI System Scope:**
- What AI technology are you implementing?
- What business processes will it impact?
- Who are the end users?
- What data will be processed?

**Compliance Requirements:**
- Which regulations apply to your industry/location?
- What internal policies must be followed?
- Are there customer or contractual requirements?

**Team Structure:**
- Who will be the project owner/lead?
- What roles are needed (technical, legal, compliance)?
- How will responsibilities be divided?

### Detailed Project Creation Process

#### Phase 1: Project Foundation

1. **Navigate to Project Creation**
   - From dashboard, click "Create New Project"
   - Or use the "+" button in the projects section

2. **Complete Project Information Form**
   ```
   Project Name: [Clear, descriptive name]
   Description: [Detailed project overview]
   AI Risk Classification: [Based on EU AI Act or your framework]

   Business Domain: [Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, etc.]
   Start Date: [Project kick-off date]
   Expected Completion: [Target go-live date]
   ```

3. **Risk Classification Guidance**
   - **Unacceptable Risk**: AI systems with unacceptable risk that are prohibited
   - **High Risk**: AI systems that may harm safety or fundamental rights
   - **Limited Risk**: AI systems with specific transparency obligations
   - **Minimal Risk**: Most AI systems with minimal regulatory requirements

#### Phase 2: Team and Governance Setup

4. **Assign Project Team**

5. **Configure Governance Framework**
   - Select primary compliance framework (EU AI Act, ISO 42001, etc.)
   - Choose secondary frameworks if applicable
   - Set up custom assessment criteria if needed

6. **Define Project Scope**
   - AI system boundaries and interfaces
   - Data sources and processing requirements
   - User groups and access levels
   - Integration points with existing systems

#### Phase 3: Initial Assessment and Planning

7. **Conduct Initial Risk Assessment**
   - Use VerifyWise's risk assessment tools
